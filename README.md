# Cam Design with Roller Follower

This repository contains the **mini-project for the Machine Dynamics course** at the University of Tehran.  
The goal was to design a **cam with a translating roller follower** that satisfies the specified motion requirements, analyze its kinematic behavior, and generate the final cam profile.

## Project Objectives
- Design a **cam profile** for a roller follower based on given displacement laws.  
- Plot **displacement, velocity, and acceleration diagrams** for each segment of follower motion.  
- Ensure smooth motion laws (Cycloidal, Simple Harmonic, Dwell segments).  
- Analyze **pressure angle** and **undercut conditions** to avoid mechanical failure.  
- Generate **pitch curve** and **cam curve** using MATLAB.  
- Compare motion laws (Cycloidal vs Simple Harmonic) and evaluate their influence.

## Methods
- **MATLAB Implementation**:  
  - Defined motion laws (rise, dwell, return).  
  - Computed displacement, velocity, and acceleration equations.  
  - Derived first and second derivatives for follower motion.  
  - Generated **pitch curve** and **cam curve** plots.  
  - Verified conditions for avoiding undercut and excessive pressure angle.  

- **Theoretical Analysis**:  
  - Closed-form equations for Cycloidal and SHM motion.  
  - Comparison of motion laws with full-rise/return vs half-rise/return.  
  - Study of jerk continuity for smooth operation.

## Results
- Displacement, velocity, and acceleration plots of the follower.  
- Pressure angle diagrams showing safe operating range.  
- Undercut analysis confirming feasibility of design.  
- Final **cam profile (pitch curve and cam curve)** successfully generated.  
- Discussion of alternative motion laws and their effects.
